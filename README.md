## Installation
The default libraries that come with the Anaconda distribution for Python will be enough to run this code. The code should be run on Python 3.

## Project Motivation
My interest in this project started a month ago when me and my wife started searching for a house. It was important for us to understand key drivers of house prices. Full list of questions I sought to answer are:
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston?
2. Who are the hosts with the most number of AirBnb listings?
3. Which are the most popular neighbourhoods based on average number of reviews?
4. Which neighbourhoods are considered the most expensive in Boston?
5. What are the key drivers of prices of AirBnb listings?

The full set of files powering this project are not included here, but are available on the kaggle site -https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.

## File Descriptions
A .ipyn is available here encompassing the full build E2E. It starts of tidying the data, and then goes straight into answering the core questions listed above. Comments are included to help the reader figure out what is being done and why.

## Results
The main results of the code are available here https://paulfru.medium.com/5-things-to-consider-when-booking-an-airbnb-in-boston-e950e08ea287
